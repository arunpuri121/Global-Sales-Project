# Global-Sales-Project

In this Project, we have made a data visualization dashboard from inside_sales data set which is provided in the repository. We have done the data visualization to show the performance of the store in the United States with the help of Different Visualization Charts, which are as follows.

<ol>
  <h3><li>Slicers:</li></h3>
  <p>The 1st visualization chart we have used are slicers to filter the performance based on <b>Years</b>, <b>quarters</b>.  </p>

  <h3><li>Cards:</li></h3>
  <p>To show the overall performance of the store we have used multiple cards like: <b>Sales</b>, <b>Quantity</b>, <b>Avg. Delivery Days</b> and <b>Total Returns</b>. This will help us in knowing the performance over different timelines </p>

  <h3><li>Map:</li></h3>
  <p>By the use of this chart we are showing the total sales in different states over the United States. where the lighter and smaller circles depict lower sales and the darker & Bigger circles depict Higher sales.</p>

  <h3><li>Flow Chart:</li></h3>
  <p>To show further insights we have made the flow chart to show the difference in profits across different regions in the US, with the highest at the top and lowest at the bottom</p>

  <h3><li>Clustered Collumn Chart:</li></h3>
  <p>To analyze the performance of the states by profit and sales, we have used this chart to plot the best top 10 performing states this will give us the best insights on the profit and sales as per the states so that we can analyze the data and can find any possible red flags.</p>

  <h3><li>DoNut Chart:</li></h3>
  <p>We have used this chart to know the dysaction of sales by the customer segment i.e.- **Consumer**, **Corporate** and **Home-Office**.</p>

  <h3><li>Pie Chart:</li></h3>
  <p>We have used this chart to know the sales in different Product Segments i.e- **Technology**, **Furniture**, **Office-Supplies**</p>

  <h3><li>Stacked Bar Chart:</li></h3>
  <p>To further Understand the performance of different Product Segments, We have classified the profits on bar charts based on Product segments. Where every bar depicts a product segment</p>

  With this complete Data Visualization Dashboard we will be able to derive exact information and with that we could take correct decision for the betterment of the company.
